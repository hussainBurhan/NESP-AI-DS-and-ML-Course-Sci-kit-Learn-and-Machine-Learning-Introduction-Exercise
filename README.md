# Heart Failure Prediction

This Python project is part of my learning journey to understand and implement machine learning algorithms. In this exercise, I'm focusing on predicting heart failure using a Random Forest Classifier based on clinical records data.

## What I'm Learning

- Loading and preprocessing datasets using Pandas.
- Building a machine learning model with Scikit-Learn.
- Evaluating model performance and tuning hyperparameters.
- Saving and loading models for future use.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
3. Place the heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv file in the same directory as your Python script.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file (main.py).
6. Run the program using a Python interpreter
7. The program will execute, train the model, and predict heart failure.

## Example Output
Running Model with 10 estimators
Accuracy is : 0.76
Running Model with 20 estimators
Accuracy is : 0.76
Running Model with 30 estimators
Accuracy is : 0.76
...
Running Model with 190 estimators
Accuracy is : 0.76

Model Loaded from File
Accuracy is : 0.76
